* A *[Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)*-like game for iOS (iPhone and iPad)
* Written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/) (compatible with Swift 2.2 / 3) and using [Sprite Kit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/)
* Written as a tutorial application for a session at the [Tampa iOS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-iOS-Meetup/)

## Introduction
![Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa, Florida](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dale-mabry-highway.jpg)

*Dale Mabry* is a game modelled after the arcade game classic *Frogger*. The player's goal is to cross a busy six-lane road without
getting hit by the cars before the timer runs out. The player has 5 lives and loses a life if s/he:

* is hit by a car, or
* runs out of time

"Dale Mabry" is a reference to [Dale Mabry Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Mabry_Highway), a major six-lane north-south road
in Tampa, Florida, where I live. I don't recommend crossing it on foot, even at an intersection!

## Notes
*Dale Mabry* was written as a tutorial app for one of my sessions at [Tampa iOS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-iOS-Meetup/), 
a monthly meetup group that I run in Tampa. The code for the player sprite and its actions was derived from the *Zombie Conga* chapter
of the book [2D iOS & tvOS Games by Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/store/2d-ios-tvos-games-by-tutorials), published by
[RayWenderlich.com's](https://www.raywenderlich.com/).
